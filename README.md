This is the modified pipe to analyze 3-tag RNA-seq data that is originally designed by Kyle Hernandez.

We nee dto Install Kyle's NGSTool to run this pipe. In order to install that tool we also need SBT.

Here it is:

http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Getting-Started/Setup.html

First go to Kyle's NGSTools project to github from here and you will find the instruction of installing SBT there.Follow this one. 

https://github.com/kmhernan/scalaNGS

One more thing! This version of NGSTools.jar that is in github somehow missed the -POLYA option. So "NGStools.jar" that is provided in this repository.

Good luck!!
